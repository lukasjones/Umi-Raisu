      PRESHIFT:
      Modern world, mostly stable. The more modernized countries are a part of an International Alliance (IA). Those not a part of the IA are treated with distrust.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 0PS (POST SHIFT): The Shift
      Geomagnetic reversal of the planet’s polarities causes what will be called The Shift.
      At first it seems to have no effect.  some headaches, nausea, light sensitivity, mostly psychosomatic cases--paranoid delusions of the hypochondriac.  
      Some accounts of altered consciousness and special manipulation. Mostly white noise packed with religious nut balls, conspiracy theorists, and mystics--people who believe in wizards and shit.
       The lights flicker every now and then.  they haven't figured that one out yet.
       </p>
      <p>
      YEARS 0PS - 9PS
      Pharmaceutical companies make a killing. One in particular, called Holistech, sells their snake oil faster than people like you or me can make a decent living.  if you ask them, the Shift changed everything.  if you ask me, people are just the same as they always were.
      Holistech is spending billions toiling day and night to, they claim, "put an end to all Shift-related illnesses and “Help Our Planet Move Forward” their capitalization not mine.
      One of Holistech’s group of scientists explores the more alternative methods suggested by those people who believe in wizards and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEARS 9PS - 12PS
      While exploring the alternative remedies the Holistech team discovers a change in human genetics. A previously unexpressed gene allows people to feel, hear, see, smell, and taste better which explains the headaches. However, while exploring this more deeply they also discover the potential to send those same sensory signals outside of their body. Honing these powers, however, is incredibly taxing on the mind and body and as the team continues to do research a few members choose to abandon the project, some go mad and a few become vegetables.
      In the end 8 remain; their minds linked telepathically sending interneuron signals to one another. 
      Around the same time others are discovering abilities granted to the human species such as the ability to generate electricity, create electromagnetic fields, sense everything around them with incredible touch, sight, smell, taste, and hearing, some have even found a way to control others’ minds. 
      A few prevalent and affluent people advertise their discoveries and some set up schools, entertainment, and services that cater to these new abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 12PS - 13PS
      With the increased brain power caused by the leaked minds of the 8 remaining Holitech scientists find a cure for the Shifts ailments in the form of what they call Sample NB37. The serum, however, not only cures headaches and nausea but just about everything else.
      Using advanced biotechnology and nanotechnology NB37 synthesizes into the subjects entire body. Every cell in the body is given a healthy dose of rehabilitation and then a thorough evaluation so that the next batch of cells are even better. 341 ML of the faithful little bacteria and ambitious little robots and you're immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Holistech scientists’ first human subject is one of their own whose mental link is severed once biomechanical synthesis is complete. He is now unable to use any psionic abilities but regenerates at an incredible rate. The severed mental link however breaks him emotionally and he runs away.
      </p>
      <p>
      The CEO of Holistech wants to sell NB37 but the scientist refuse. One of the Holistech 7, HARVEY (#7), is married to the CEO’s daughter and they recently had a child before his mind link. The child was born with a terminal illness. The CEO explains that NB37 will obviously save her life so the scientists agree as long as it is distributed evenly and for free. The CEO agrees for the PR and his own eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 13PS
      The Holistech scientists, now called the Holistech 7, announce their discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
      They began building manufacturing facilities and start implementing a test to decide who is deserving and worthy of such a gift.
      </p>
      <p>
      People contest the test saying they are unfair and others go as far as to be against NB37, nicknamed “the elixir”, all together. Opposition is formed by both the highly religious and intellectual.
      </p>
      <p>
      The International Alliance (IA) demands that they get all rights to the NB37 serum. The Holistech 7 refuse but the CEO sells them out for a retarded amount of money. The IA now owns all rights to the NB37 serum and Holistech 7 team.
      </p>
      <p>

      YEAR 13PS - 17PS
      After months of deliberation the IA hastily decide to distribute NB37 to each member country of the IA depending on population in an attempt to be fair, and once distributed each country can decide what to do with their portion.
      </p>
      <p>
      Some countries give it away for free, some sell it, some only give it to their elite or aristocracy. Citizens of less than favorable distribution policies jump borders and immigrate to other countries. Tensions rise and strict border control and even martial law becomes commonplace in many places.
      Most countries suffer from protests, strikes, and riots, and a few even fall to revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Non-IA countries are excluded and therefore pissed. One in particular, with nuclear capabilities, threatens to use their nukes if they do not receive their fair share.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 17PS
      A frater carrying doses of serum NB37 goes missing and the Non-IA country is blamed (probably rightfully so).
      A IA with past aggression with the Non-IA country launches a preemptive nuke after a year of heated debate.
      All bets are off.
      </p>
      <p>

      YEARS 17PS - 19PS
      Wars break out throughout the world. First between IA and Non-IA countries but due to past conflicts, new and old international tensions, and political instability, wars start no matter one’s membership status.
      Eventually nukes are introduced to the World War and over the course of a single month they pepper the skies leaving most major urban areas and most governmental and military centers in ruins.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 18PS
      While the chaos swells Holistech’s CEO establishes a smallholding on a large, mostly insignificant, island far from most of the conflict. Here he starts construction of a huge utopian fortress for him and his friends and family to live out the rest of their lives in peace. He calls the city Polis Goji.

      </p>
      <p>
      YEARS 19PS - unknown
      Remaining countries continue to fight utilizing psionics and immortals.
      </p>
      <p>
      A decade pasts and all major countries of the world are left desolate wastelands; remnants of their past glory. Throughout the world the war continues in small pockets indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEARS 19PS - 27PS
      Regular communication between Holistech’s smallholding and the rest of the world is cut off. Polis Goji’s construction efficiently continues, however, CEO is found dead before its completion. His Daughter immediately takes charge and and pours all her attention into taking over the rest of the island instead.
      </p>
      <p>
      Using a military made up of mercenaries and dissatisfied militaries Holistech takes over the island.
      The island is divided into colonies each ruled by the military leaders who helped establish them.
      Holistech takes with them anyone from the mainland who agrees to be loyal. These immigrants are given newly conquered land to colonize.
      </p>
      <p>
      In return for the land granted the state leaders and colonists must provide a tax of supplies they produce and are subject to a draft that takes the militarized states’ soldiers for Holistech’s use.
      Polis Goji is made the capital city of the new Holistech Empire.

      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 27PS - 47PS
      The island remains mostly stable as Holistech Empire and its vassal colonies consolidate power.
      Some indigenous populations join the newly founded colonies. Some attempt to cohabitate; staying independent socially and culturally though interacting economically. Most, however, choose seclusion, refusing to pay taxes and staying hidden. Some are nomadic; only a few are hostile, though tensions between natives and colonists span across all groups. Small conflicts arise though nothing major since the initial conquest. One moderately sized part of the Island, which is home to harsh climates and difficult terrain, remains entirely untouched by the colonists. Those who do venture in usually don’t return.
      The Empress of Holistech goes a bit mad and declares herself a demigod. She believes that the mainland is hell and Polis Goji is heaven. The gates of Polis Goji are closed to all. However, according to her, upon death you are judged on your service to Holistech and if you are deemed worthy you are allowed entry into Polis Goji, otherwise you are sent to the mainland to suffer in its endless war.
      Politics between colonies start to get strained as agendas change. Things get worse as Polis Goji becomes more demanding
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 47PS - 56PS
      Out of nowhere transmissions from Polis Goji cease.
      The draft ceases entirely but regular taxes, though far less severe, are still payed.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 56PS - 70PS
      Overtime things decentralize among the colonies and past allegiances to Holistech are blurred. Taxes to Holitech’s capital city Polis Goji become more lax.
      Each state/colony suffers from a number of issues and though there is little demand from Holistech there is also no aid. Some fall victim to famine, disease, floods, and other natural disasters, and some, against all odds, prevail. Eleven colonies remain varying in size and strength, each one very unique depending on their piece of island geography, the group of colonists who originally settled there, and the military discipline their founders perfected. All of them also still claim allegiance to Holistech, however this does not prevent hostilities towards each other.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 70PS - 72PS
      The First Colonial War is declared marking the first violent aggression between colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 72PS - 119PS
      Hostilities between colonies get worse. More wars are waged, alliances are made and broken, and land is taken and lost. Eventually only six independent colonies remain.
      However, the colonies do manage to develop some economically, governmentally, and infrastructurally.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 119PS - 141PS
      Each of the six colonies vie for superiority; some economically and some politically. Small and large wars continue and it seems that any remnants of past unity is lost except that they all claim loyalty to Holistech in order to create legitimacy for their agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
      YEAR 141PS - 153PS
      Twentieth Colonial War: is declared. The war sees the highest death count compared to any other colonial war before it, mostly due to its grueling length. The war has already lasted 12 years and there appears to be no end in sight.
      </p>
